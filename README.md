# ADMonteCarlo_Engine Currently in Development

Looking to make a platform capable of computing Monte Carlo Estimates of various stochastic processes and their sensitivities using Hyperdual numbers constructed using the Cayley-Dickson Construction. The project currently works using double precision varibles but will be updated to use MPFR variables for user-defined precision of calculations and will use AngryMaciek's Hypercomplex class.
Project is being developed in a WSL2 - Ubuntu environment using CMake for Makefile generation and in a VSCode IDE. If you wish to clone this project and work from another IDE, you can do so without the .vscode folder but make sure to update the include path accordingly in your environment.
