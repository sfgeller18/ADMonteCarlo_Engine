# ADMonteCarlo_Engine Currently in Development

Looking to make a platform capable of computing Monte Carlo Estimates of various stochastic processes. Project will use MPFR for user-defined floating point precision of calculations and will implement Automatic Differentiation of the Estimates using AngryMaciek's Hypercomplex class.
Project is being developed in a WSL2 - Ubuntu environment using CMake for Makefile generation and in a VSCode IDE. If you wish to clone this project and work from another IDE, you can do so without the .vscode folder but make sure to update the include path accordingly in your environment.
